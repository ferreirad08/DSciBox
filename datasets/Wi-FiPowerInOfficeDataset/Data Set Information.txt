Description:

Wi-FiPowerInOfficeDataset is a MAT-file (.mat) with three variables: samples, rps_coordinates and aps_coordinates.

The samples variable has 16 classes of 220 instances each, where each class refers to one reference point (RP).
It has a total of 3520 observations in dBm of 08 attributes, where each attribute refers to one Wi-Fi access point (AP) based on NodeMCU-8266 [http://www.ai-thinker.com/pro_view-67.html].
The last column is the RP identifier (ID).

The variable rps_coordinates has the three-dimensional coordinates (length, width and height) of the 16 RPs, respectively in each line.

The variable aps_coordinates has the three-dimensional coordinates (length, width and height) of the 08 APs, respectively in each line.
